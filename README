# The Meaning Discordancy

An experimental game of emergent meaning.

## Description

This game will use NLP libraries to perform vector similarity calculations on player input as they take turns mainly tagging images. As the game progresses, themes emerge, and the players find themselves in a battle of idealogy where the winner must create their meaning more efficiently or lose. That's the idea anyway. That is quite a ways away.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Program runs in docker.

### Installing

* Currently, installation files are scattered and the docker commands to start and stop and create and delete docker containers are unimplemented.
* To install front end, open ./src/client and execute npm run install:all, and npm run start:all
* To install python backend, open ./src/nlp/powershell

### Executing program

* NLP Similarity Service(./src/nlp/powershell)
```
./run.ps1
```
This will start the nlp similarity evaluation service, and its resources.
* Angular Client(./src/client/)
```
npm run start:all
```
This will start storybook for component testing, and the client application.
